[x] Control-] (or tab/shift tab) for multiple lines was wanted very badly!!
[x] Control-Enter, Control-f, Control-b
[ ] Increase indent after do
    (easy to extend this to if, then, else, ->, let)


[ ] Filewatch the .world-state dir.
[ ] Have entityIDs match filenames again
    (can tag with -StartCode if desired and clip it).
[ ] Create object from entityID.yaml when new.
[ ] Reset properties from .yaml when modified.
[ ] Check Shape and Properties to see if they
    are the same to avoid recreating physics
    shapes unnecessarily
[ ] Remove object when .yaml deleted.
[ ] Delete .yaml when object deleted.

[ ] Get rid of all the hidden filewatchers in CodeEditor and TextGL/Halive.
    Replace with a single filewatcher operated by Rumpus that triggers TextGL/Halive.
    Give it a "pathsLastModifiedByUs :: Map FilePath UTCTime"
    that we can update internally to debounce internal changes.

Crashed when .world-state dir was missing.
Crashed when Jason moved an object (thus creating a file via dropbox)
while my rumpus was trying to delete.


Demonstrate State and Reader monads to Jason.
