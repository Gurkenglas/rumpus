TRAILER

[ ] Sync music
[ ] Add all scene paths to the Pd search path!

BUGS:
[x] Sampler values don't restore to 1 correctly
    (or is that because I changed the scale?)
[x] Knobs jump on hand grab rather than continuing
[x] Stepped knobs still don't send correct vals

IDEAS:

[ ] VISIBLE SYNTHESIZER

[ ] Cloud for tree

[x] Edit sky to move and twinkle

[x] Multiple Ribbons

[x] Multiple Verylogues

[ ] Draw a physics bowl and drop balls into it

[ ] Pull objects out to add to the Attractor agglommeration
    Surround with huge white room


[x] Clock system that advances per-object according to a timestep,
    for use in speed-changing ribbon and solar system. Can go backwards too!

FINAL SCENE:
Create New Scene,
Start importing things from everywhere else to show interactions
