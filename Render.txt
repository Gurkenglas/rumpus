Ideas for customizing rendering:

Shader component. Give these a key and we can render everything with the same shader key at once.

Uniform component; can just be an ECSMonad action that does whatever it wants in the closure right before rendering
(could just name this PreRenderAction or something)

RenderGroup? Could combine uniform plus shader?
