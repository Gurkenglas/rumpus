Coming Soon

Multiplayer
Shareable Object libraries
A much, much friendlier VR native language (no typing)
In-world audio synth-graph building
In-world shader and geometry editing
Built-in transparency & shadows
Customizable render pipeline
Boiling language down to a kernel and fallback renderer (entire system live-editable)
In-world web browser as a catchall for non-VR content




Known problems:
Two ways to set, ==> and setX functions. Historical bug, will be unified soon.
Script performance can impact render performace; due to Rumpus being mostly single threaded. New archictecture underway!
No undo, syntax highlighting or code completion. Coming soon!
Transform hierarchy can't interact with physics. Redesign in progress.
Only two shapes: Cube and Sphere. Mainly due to extra physics effort; more coming soon!







(scene idea: rather than representing via a cube,
represent with a miniature view of what the scene loader
looks like that then expands around you while the world
in front of you disappears.

could do a fade-out of the scene except for the mini-loader-cube,
then have it zoom around you!)
