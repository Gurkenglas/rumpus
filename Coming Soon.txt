Coming Soon

Multiplayer
Shareable Object libraries
A much, much friendlier VR native language (no typing)
In-world audio synth-graph building
In-world shader and geometry editing
Built-in transparency & shadows
Customizable render pipeline
Boiling language down to a kernel and fallback renderer (entire system live-editable)
In-world web browser as a catchall for non-VR content




Known problems:
Two ways to set, ==> and setX functions. Historical bug, will be unified soon.
Script performance can impact render performace; due to Rumpus being mostly single threaded. New archictecture underway!
No undo, syntax highlighting or code completion. Coming soon!
Transform hierarchy can't interact with physics. Redesign in progress.
Only two shapes: Cube and Sphere. Mainly due to extra physics effort; more coming soon!
