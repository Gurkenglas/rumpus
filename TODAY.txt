- [ ] Widget for switching kinematic on/off
- [ ] Widget for switching contact response on/off
    - one widget type for sum types (e.g. ShapeType) 
    - one for list types (e.g. PhysicsProperties)

- Make 3D icons out of primitives : )
    e.g. oO for collision response or something
    Would be nice to make these in-engine and just have them be .yaml files,
    but we'd have to make sure to figure out how to not be re-parsing the yaml
    on every creation!

- [ ] Widgets for OnStart, OnCollision, OnUpdate code
    - OnSelect that detects raycasts

- [ ] Widget text labels
    - Make "selection" a Maybe in freetype-gl-mini


- [x] OnCollisionEnter/OnCollisionExit
    (just keep a Set of collision pairs, detect entries and exits that way)
    Collisions should be their own system.

- [ ] Add Hands system that simply adds hands and head entities and makes them available as 
        hndLeftHand hndRightHand hndHead
        also isLeftHand isRightHand isHand isHandOrHead isHead
        Use this in Controls to get rid of string-based hand finding.

- [ ] Animations can be added in OnStart

- [ ] Component library so we can define an entity, name it and spawn it

- [x] Put script code in a reader monad so we can have an implicit self!
        then have all the code use that.

- [ ] Handy note: we can use start function to define everything else by just setting properties on self.

- [ ] Find a way to not leak derivedcomponents; e.g. if we want to change the shape of an object.
        deriveComponent could remove any existing rigidbody, but if we can only derive components currently
        by calling deriveComponent on everything then we'd have to drop and recreate everyhing even when editing a non-related component.

- [ ] Fix readArray in pd-hs -Â it should return an unboxed Vector rather than a list

GOAL FOR TODAY:
Create an object that blows sound bubbles when you touch it
[x] Speech recorder with OnEnter/OnExit!
