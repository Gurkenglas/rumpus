- [ ] Widget for switching kinematic on/off
- [ ] Widget for switching contact response on/off
    - one widget type for sum types (e.g. ShapeType) 
    - one for list types (e.g. PhysicsProperties)

- [ ] Widgets for OnStart, OnCollision, OnUpdate code
    - OnSelect that detects raycasts

- [ ] Widget text labels
    - Make "selection" a Maybe in freetype-gl-mini


- [x] OnCollisionEnter/OnCollisionExit
    (just keep a Set of collision pairs, detect entries and exits that way)
    Collisions should be their own system.

- [ ] Add Hands system that simply adds hands and head entities and makes them available as 
        hndLeftHand hndRightHand hndHead
        also isLeftHand isRightHand isHand isHandOrHead isHead
        Use this in Controls to get rid of string-based hand finding.

- [ ] Animations can be added in OnStart

- [ ] Component library so we can define an entity, name it and spawn it

- [x] Put script code in a reader monad so we can have an implicit self!
        then have all the code use that.

GOAL FOR TODAY:
Create an object that blows sound bubbles when you touch it
[x] Speech recorder with OnEnter/OnExit!
