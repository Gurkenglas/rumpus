- [ ] Widget for switching kinematic on/off
- [ ] Widget for switching contact response on/off
    - one widget type for sum types (e.g. ShapeType) 
    - one for list types (e.g. PhysicsProperties)

- [ ] Widgets for OnStart, OnCollision, OnUpdate code
    - OnSelect that detects raycasts

- [ ] Widget text labels
    - Make "selection" a Maybe in freetype-gl-mini


- [x] OnCollisionEnter/OnCollisionExit
    (just keep a Set of collision pairs, detect entries and exits that way)
    Collisions should be their own system.

- [ ] Animation can be done in OnStart

- [ ] Component library so we can define an entity, name it and spawn it

- [ ] Put script code in a reader monad so we can have an implicit self!
        then have all the code use that.

GOAL FOR TODAY:
Create an object that blows sound bubbles when you touch it
[x] Speech recorder with OnEnter/OnExit!
