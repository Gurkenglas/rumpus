[x] Try state-saving paint-brush?

[ ] Physics demo
    Ocean example: make pool

[ ] Titled doors with tiled floor for loader room


[ ] Put manual into Rumpus

[ ] Try to repro "file locked" error messages in release build

[ ] Add knobs to more objects


[ ] Hmmm... a very good reason to keep files in the folder is for sharing;
    you should be able to just zip up a folder and drop it into the rumpus dir
    to pass something to someone else.

    OK: a possible plan for this.
    Keep code files in Scenes.
    Keep pd patches in Rumpus Root.
    Add "Import" to browse your scenes, and copy file into current scene when grabbed

[ ] Brick object with xyz color knobs? Can't really handle the "too big" case well yet though (well, what if we allow XY freely and then set Z center according to size?)
