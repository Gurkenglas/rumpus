[ ] Put manual into Rumpus

[ ] Try to repro "file locked" error messages in release build

[ ] Add knobs to more objects

[ ] Try state-saving paint-brush?

[ ] Hmmm... a very good reason to keep files in the folder is for sharing;
    you should be able to just zip up a folder and drop it into the rumpus dir
    to pass something to someone else.

    OK: a plan for this.
    Keep code files in Scenes.
    Keep pd patches in Rumpus Root.
    Add "Import" to browse your scenes, and copy file into current scene when grabbed
