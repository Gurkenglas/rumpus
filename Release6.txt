[x] Try state-saving paint-brush?

[x] Physics demo
    Ocean example: make pool
    Attractors

[ ] Titled doors with tiled floor for loader room

[ ] Fix exception catching

[ ] Put manual into Rumpus

[ ] Try to repro "file locked" error messages in release build

[ ] Add knobs to more objects




[ ] Hmmm... a very good reason to keep files in the folder is for sharing;
    you should be able to just zip up a folder and drop it into the rumpus dir
    to pass something to someone else.

    OK: a possible plan for this:
    Keep code files in Scenes.
    Keep pd patches in Rumpus Root. (must tell users they need to copy these manually, but that's OK. Could also add current scene to search path too.)
    Add "Import" to browse your scenes,
        Copy file into current scene when grabbed.

[ ] Brick object with xyz color knobs? Can't really handle the "too big" case well yet though (well, what if we allow XY freely and then set Z center according to size?)

[ ] Grappling hook/gravity gun object.
[ ] Feynman lectures


[ ] Avatar plan:
    use getUserName. Hash this to get an entityID. Spawn an entity with this ID that represents the player upon entering, delete it when leaving a scene.
    Since it will be an Animated body, other players can delete you if needed if stale players remain from crashes etc.
