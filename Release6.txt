DONE
[x] Try state-saving paint-brush?

[x] Physics demo
    Ocean example: make pool
    Attractors

[x] Hmmm... a very good reason to keep files in the folder is for sharing;
    you should be able to just zip up a folder and drop it into the rumpus dir
    to pass something to someone else.

    OK: a possible plan for this:
    Keep code files in Scenes.
    Keep pd patches in Rumpus Root. (must tell users they need to copy these
    manually, but that's OK. Could also add current scene to search path too.)
    Add "Import" to browse your scenes,
        Copy file into current scene when grabbed.

[x] Better hand tips
[x] Fix keyboard hanging around when returning to Home
[x] Fix exception catching
[x] Fix body updates from Animated to Physical
    (probably Mass = 0??)
[x] Add pitch control to sampler!
    [x] needs bidirectional exponential knob type
[x] Put manual into Rumpus
    [ ] Simple Text script to
        split on ***Name,
        take to next ***
        insert comment blocks
        write to pristine/manual/Name.hs
[x] Scene Folder code still broken for text editors
[x] Doors with title plaques and tiled floor for loader room
[x] Door opening animation

REMAINING

[u] Add 10foot hand controls explanation to Home
    "Open Object Library"
    "Press Import to copy objects from other scenes"
    "Drag and drop objects here to destroy them"
    "Hold, point and release to teleport to platforms (where available)"
    "Press to return Home"

[ ] Sound for
    [x] pool
    [ ] Attractor, ribbon, cubesea?
        [ ] Use Verylogue!

[ ] Skywriter, draw something, it gets projected to 100 feet, hangs in the air,
    then falls onto ground
    (needed for script)

[ ] Add knobs to more objects

[ ] Try to repro "file locked" error messages in release build

[ ] Weird head thing when no hand pose

MAYBE

[ ] Obvious UI for changing scene now that we have door plaques;
    click the plaque.

[ ] Funny idea for hacking in interface for unfinished features:
    setSceneName "Foo"
    just tell users they can call this from anywhere.
    Obviously not great since it will happen every time the object is created;
    maybe instruct users to make their own buttons too if they're going to
    do this : )
    Could do something similar for file management;
    deleteThisCodeFile

[ ] Add connections from objects like Platforms to their respective children.
    Do this in a generalized way?
    connectToChildren
    myConnections ==> UVector EntityID
    Can add and remove this upon selecting the object.
    Could limit it to first N children if it is a performance problem


LATER
[ ] Brick object with xyz color knobs? Can't really handle the "too big" case
    well yet though (well, what if we allow XY freely and
    then set Z center according to size?)

[ ] Grappling hook/gravity gun object.
[ ] Feynman lectures


[ ] Avatar plan:
    use getUserName. Hash this to get an entityID. Spawn an entity with
    this ID that represents the player upon entering,
    delete it when leaving a scene.
    Since it will be an Animated body, other players can delete you
    if needed if stale players remain from crashes etc.

[ ] Birds! Just two flapping cubes...
    Sunset over cube sea
