BUGS
    [x] Crashes if a .yaml object has a StartCodeFile for a .hs file that no longer exists.
    [x] Pressing down and up reloads the file ?!?

KEYBOARD
    [x] Fix selection with keypads
    [x] Vari-size keys for space, arrows, enter, backspace etc.
        - Pass a width/height into the key construction function,
          and accumulate x and y offsets
            (add tab, select all, copy, paste buttons)
    [ ] Knob System/API

INTERACTION
    [x] Implement folder versioning
        (have rumpus make its folders in a folder of its build date)

PERFORMANCE

    Do as many simple things as possible to help protect users from getting into gross states
    (and later implement the full async rendering plan)
    [ ] Object limit: set to e.g. 5000, see if we can render
        that many Holographic statically, then with update funcs
        update:
        we can render 200 animated OK right now.

    [ ] Physics efficiency: use mutable vectors like we do in OpenVR;
        possibly get whole transforms rather than quats/positions to reduce calculation?
        Get all objects in one big pass.
        Limit number of physics objects to again something like 1000.

    [ ] Reset button (e.g. hold both application buttons)
        Possibly automatically reset if low performance is detected?

    [x] See performance impact of System.Timeout on Scripts.
        If run on outer loop, should hopefully be OK, but can't detect which script caused problem then
        so must pause all scripts.

        See if we can fix loop detection (i.e. let x = x in a myUpdate, which crashed rumpus earlier)

        - Looks like GHC can't detect let x = x. Let's try System.Timeout for this,
        and if it fails, set a flag to stop executing scripts until new code is received.

    [x] investigate glitches when code reloading
        5/16: The profiler taught us that these are simply the actual execution of the start script
        after it's been compiled! So this really can't be fixed fully without the new system.
        Can look at/demo strategies for mitigating this, e.g. turning off removeChildren and re-using
        them (e.g. setting a new myUpdate on them), though that requires extra care.


VIDEO
    [x] Test cropped screen recording quality/legibility
        - Use SteamVR as the recorded window to avoid hiccup bug in Rumpus's mirror.
        DONE: From testing with OBS, I think this'll do the job for the first release.
        Especially if I increase OBS capture res.

[x] Use 80columns for all text screens
[x] Make shift momentary
[x] Attach keyboard to selected object
[x] Increase keyrepeat speed
[x] Fix stale key bugs
[x] Implement momentary shift
[x] Fix teleport ray not appearing unless hitting geo
[x] Compilation feedback (maybe this will be fixed by the new error panel setup)
[x] New object creation
    - Think through the yaml/persistence story one more time.
    Object library
    Have Main.hs of room automatically arrange all possible objects on the shelves
    Scene defines namespace of library

    Click app button to summon a spinning cube; grab it to create a new object.
    Have that object start with default code that can be edited.
        (find all files in scene with name NewObject##, split ##, parse int, grab highest, increment.)
    Split an object to create a shared instance.
    Split a code editor to fork a new file.
    Throw an object into the void to delete.

[x] Deletion by "putting back" into library, like in The Gallery
