The tangible raycasting currently employed for teleportation
would make a very good demo of augmented sensory perception.

Create a scene with various objects (spheres, cubes, pyramids etc.)
Demonstrate that you can walk through the scene blindfolded by
sweeping with the raycaster. Implement varying strength/frequency by distance.

Then show that you can see just as well behind you as you can in front of you
by walking backwards through the scene.

Finally, show that you can shoot a moving target behind your back using solely
the beam-sense.
