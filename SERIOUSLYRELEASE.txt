[ ] Spruce up the scene loader scene


[x] Add crossfade transition to loader (use addDelayedAction + OpenVR util)
[x] Fix pd patches still reloading on save
    [x] This probably means local-reload prevention isn't working

[x] Finish keyboard
[x] Keyrepeat broken
[x] Keyboard not dismissed on delete
[x] Keyboard doesn't show on spawn
    (until reclick, because there is no startExpr intially)
    (fixed this by not selecting spawned entities, since you don't want to every time
    (e.g. spawning notes))
