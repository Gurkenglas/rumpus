[ ] Framerate pass
        Consider how hard doing a basic multithreaded renderer would be... could be great!!

[ ] Audio latency pass

[ ] Try to rebuild space pirate trainer! Use that to inform further improvements...

[ ] Object duplication
        If holding with one hand, grab with other hand and pull out a copy. Simple!
        Name by just incrementing a counter?
        Put the name on one side of the cube??

[ ] Blank object creation

[ ] Fix undo memory pressure

[ ] Object & scene management

[ ] Fix mirror window
    Go fullscreen by default and set GLFW_CURSOR_DISABLED for VR (and GLFW_CURSOR_HIDDEN for nonVR? we want the window-bounding but no cursor)

[ ] A few more object types: whatever bullet makes easy. Cone, tetra, cylinder, etc.

[ ] Teleporting!

New later thoughts:
- Clean up GLFW gamepad API for local multiplayer games!
- Think about registering components at runtime, this would be probably handier than the ScriptData system.
    (Perhaps just have files that are automatically loaded like a Types.hs?)
