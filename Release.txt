[ ] Teleporting!

[ ] SteamVR keyboard

[ ] Framerate pass
        Consider how hard doing a basic multithreaded renderer would be... could be great!!
        [i] Seems to be much better since fixing the error renderers recreating themselves
        	on each keypress!

[ ] Audio latency pass

[ ] BUG: Fix audio not working in standalone executable!

[ ] Try to rebuild space pirate trainer! Use that to inform further improvements...
	[ ] Object-to-hand attachment
		Double click trigger (good for attach, but not detach because we want to use trigger) 
		Grip Button? Move teleport to above thumbpad

[x] Object duplication
        If holding with one hand, grab with other hand and pull out a copy. Simple!
        [ ] Figure out getting new instance of code.
        	Should copy the CompiledValue from the CodeEditor to avoid delay when cloning.
	        Name by just incrementing a counter?
	        Put the name on one side of the cube??

[ ] Blank object creation

[ ] Fix undo, check if it was the culprit in causing judder and switch design if so

[ ] Object & scene management
		Swipeable button to access advanced features? Swipe to the button you want and then click down?
		Or do SPT-style menu?
		Obviously find way to make hand editable so we can implement new hands while inside
		Delete with a laser ray that slowly vaporizes the object so you can change your mind
		Blank object creation
		Open object library
		Multiselect by swiping through a bunch of objects or lasering
		Play/Pause

[ ] Fix mirror window
    Go fullscreen by default and set GLFW_CURSOR_DISABLED for VR (and GLFW_CURSOR_HIDDEN for nonVR? we want the window-bounding but no cursor)

[ ] A few more object types: whatever bullet makes easy. Cone, tetra, cylinder, etc.


Later thoughts:
- Clean up GLFW gamepad API for local multiplayer games!
- Think about registering components at runtime in user scripts. 
	This would be probably handier than the ScriptData system.
    (Perhaps just have files that are automatically loaded like a Types.hs?)
