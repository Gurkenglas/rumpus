When you boot up Rumpus you'll be in the **Scene Loader**. Choose one of the
orbs around you to visit that world.

Pick up objects by grabbing them with the trigger. Hold the grip buttons
to bring up the **Teleport Beam** - point it at platforms and release when it
turns green and starts to rumble to teleport to that location.

Press and hold the "App Button" (above the touchpad on your Vive controller)
on one hand to bring up the **Object Bouquet**. Pull objects out of the
bouquet with your other hand to bring them into the world. To destroy an
object, drag it into the center of the Bouquet and release.

You can import objects from other scenes by pressing "Import", then choosing
a scene, then grabbing one of its objects. It will be copied into your scene
so you're free to modify it without changing the original.

To return to the **Scene Loader**, click the green orb that appears at the
bottom of the wand when holding the App Button with your other hand.

You can create your own scene by clicking the "New Scene" orb in
the **Scene Loader**. Scenes are persistent, so you can build arrangements
and revist them later.
