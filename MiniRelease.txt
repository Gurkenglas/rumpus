[x] Teleporting
    [x] Player pose stuff is all screwy. Fix the inv44 nonsense etc. in vr-pal.
    [x] If doing head, do hands too.
    [x] Headlight doesn't follow player, since head44 is untransformed. Shouldn't head44 just be transformed in vr-pal?
    
    [ ] Add a ray and visual feedback for what you'll teleport to.
    [ ] Could possibly do an animation...

[x] Scale matrix caching - parallel holding of scaled and normal matrix... is this possible in an easy way?

[ ] Text matrix caching - many to cache here; the correction matrix, the textpose-to-normalpose

[ ] Crasher when turning controllers on after launch

[ ] Finish keyboard
    [x] Get touchpad down event from steamVR


[ ] Create intro object
        Have it be the only thing that you start out seeing, and have the other objects on other platforms?
        TRY EDITING ME


[ ] 1080p render for video? 
    This would be possibly quite easy with a threaded render that takes the last world state and renders it!
    This is where we can let our immutable structures shine :)
    (but make sure we're not querying anything mutable like DynamicsWorld, though I think that's taken care of by how Rumpus is structured.)

[ ] Add microphone-reactive object

[ ] Add Tab, Shift-Tab, Control-Enter support to freetype-gl-mini 
    (tab operates on beginning of line, insert or remove 4 spaces, easy : ))

[ ] Add notes to Early Access notes about the intentions of rumpus to become something that "normal people" can use, 
    but is itself the tool in which such a friendlier and more powerful environment is to be created.

[x] Fix hands swapping for haptics
[x] Fix error message positioning 
        [ ] (add line numbers?? any way to do that easily??)

[x] Build city

[x] Add exception handler to update and start functions. See older cubensis code for instructions..

[x] Find Windows documents directory, copy scenes there and load from there
    getUserDocumentsDirectory
    copy scenes 

[x] Fix audio on release builds! 
    Make sure HRTFs are working, we might need to include the openal folder in the release,
    or figure out the openal api
    NOTES: what have I learned:
    The problem is in communication between libpd and the pd patches...
    The pd patches don't seem to get anything from libpd when I send values.
    I am able to print, but print only works if it is a string.

    GOOD NEWS:
    It seems to be linked to the msys64 directory again. I renamed it and it works perfectly again.
    MYSTERY: things work fine with the testz folder on the desktop that I built from pd-haskell tests.
    Why are they not affected? What is the remaining link to msys64? msys64 is not in the windows path...
    But regardless, I can probably just ignore this issue since most people won't have an msys64 path to begin with!
    but I do need to fix it so I can develop...
    Try a tool to see what files are being opened. 

[x] Finish faster code-update system.
        Basic idea: we want to pass char buffers to the GHC API.
        Maybe premature optimization, but could have TextBuffer store each line in parallel as a char buffer and a Seq, 
        rebuilding the char buffer on each change to a line, and just gluing the buffers together when dumping its contents as a single char buffer.

        While passing it off, also save the file on a background queue thread.
        We also want to pause the file watcher while we save our version of the file so it doesn't resubmit it for recompilation.

        Right now, have selected code hook into CodeEditor and pass a String to Halive via a CompilationRequest. 
        Disable code loading from files to ensure that this fixes things, then implement the filewatcher pausing.
        Switch file saving to be async.

        [ ] I've commented out refreshTextRendererFromFile in CodeEditor.hs:264
            (since it's the cause of the pauses while typing!) while I figure out
            the right way to refresh the text - should do the readFile call 
            in the background upon receiving the FileEvent, but also want to be able
            to pause that when we are making edits.

            (something something file modification date?? How to communicate this to this different bits though...)


[ ] Performance notes:
    The data buffering will be a lot faster once we've got everything in aligned vectors;
    currently we're doing tons and tons of lookups on entityIDs when we'd rather just iterate a bunch of buffers in parallel:
    case in point being rendering, we want [Color] [M44] that we can dump into StreamingArrayBuffers directly

import Rumpus

-- This is the code that generates the shape you see above.

-- These variables change how the object looks and behaves
rotationSpeed = 1

-- Try changing the colors!
objectColor = colorRGB (1,2,3)

-- Here's where we actually set up the object!
start = do
    myColor ==> objectColor

    -- This is the "Update" function, which gets run 90 times per second to
    -- to define how the object behaves.
    -- In this case, we're having the object change 
    -- its rotation and color 
    -- based on what time it is.
    myUpdate ==> do
        now <- getNow
        myPose ==> toPose def { posePosition = V3 0 1 0
                              , poseOrientation = axisAngle (V3 0 1 0) (now * rotationSpeed) 
                              }
