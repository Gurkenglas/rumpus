INTERACTION
    [ ] New object creation
        - Think through the yaml/persistence story one more time.
        Object library
        Have Main.hs of room automatically arrange all possible objects on the shelves
        Scene defines namespace of library

    [ ] Compilation feedback (maybe this will be fixed by the new error panel setup)

PERFORMANCE
    Do as many simple things as possible to help protect users from getting into gross states
    (and later implement the full async rendering plan)
    [ ] Object limit: set to e.g. 5000, see if we can render
        that many Holographic statically, then with update funcs
        update:
        we can render 200 animated OK right now.

    [ ] Physics efficiency: use mutable vectors like we do in OpenVR;
        possibly get whole transforms rather than quats/positions to reduce calculation?
        Get all objects in one big pass.
        Limit number of physics objects to again something like 1000.
    [ ] Reset button (e.g. hold both application buttons)
        Possibly automatically reset if low performance is detected?

KEYBOARD
    [ ] Vari-size keys for space, arrows, enter, backspace etc.
        - Pass a width/height into the key construction function,
          and accumulate x and y offsets

    [ ] Knob System/API
VIDEO
    [ ] Test cropped screen recording quality/legibility
        - Use SteamVR as the recorded window to avoid hiccup bug in Rumpus's mirror.
        UPDATE: from testing with OBS, I think this'll do the job for the first release.
        Especially if I increase OBS capture res.

[ ] Make shift momentary
[ ] Fix teleport ray not appearing unless hitting geo
[x] Attach keyboard to selected object
[x] Increase keyrepeat speed
[ ] Use 80columns for all text screens
[ ] See if we can fix loop detection (i.e. let x = x in a myUpdate, which crashed rumpus earlier)
[ ] I definitely wanted code forking in my last session!!! Test that again.

[ ] Deletion by "putting back" into library, like in The Gallery

[ ] Add letter-to-buffer animation where they fly off the keyboard (add a grey version for immediate feedback)
