INTERACTION
    [ ] New object creation
        - Think through the yaml/persistence story one more time.
    [ ] Compilation feedback (maybe this will be fixed by the new error panel setup)

PERFORMANCE
    Do as many simple things as possible to help protect users from getting into gross states
    (and later implement the full async rendering plan)
    [ ] Object limit: set to e.g. 5000, see if we can render
        that many Holographic statically, then with update funcs

    [ ] Physics efficiency: use mutable vectors like we do in OpenVR;
        possibly get whole transforms rather than quats/positions to reduce calculation?
        Get all objects in one big pass.
        Limit number of physics objects to again something like 1000.
    [ ] Reset button (e.g. hold both application buttons)
        Possibly automatically reset if low performance is detected?

KEYBOARD
    [ ] Vari-size keys for space, arrows, enter, backspace etc.
        - Pass a width/height into the key construction function,
          and accumulate x and y offsets

    [ ] Knob System/API
VIDEO
    [ ] Test cropped screen recording quality/legibility
        - Use SteamVR as the recorded window to avoid hiccup bug in Rumpus's mirror.
