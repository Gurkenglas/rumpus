Implement Persistent mapped storage
Render both eyes at once
Render text to texture
[ ] Performance notes:
    The data buffering will be a lot faster once we've got everything in aligned vectors;
    currently we're doing tons and tons of lookups on entityIDs when we'd rather just iterate a bunch of buffers in parallel:
    case in point being rendering, we want [Color] [M44] that we can dump into StreamingArrayBuffers directly
