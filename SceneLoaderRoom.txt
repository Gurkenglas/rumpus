When you hold the button, the bottom of the hand grows an exit button.
Click that to close the current scene and return to the loader room

In the loader room, you see all of the scenes that currently exist, and there is also always an empty new scene.
Previous scenes are represented by the world positions of all their saved entities.
We still monitor the dropbox so those positions will be autoupdated.
When too many objects, stop previewing.
Click the scene to have it envelop you.

Will have to update scene observation logic to only
create and delete the representations rather than the real objects.

Users can easily be in multiple parallel worlds and pop over to visit.

You should be able to customize the loader scene since it's just like any other rumpus scene.



(another funny idea for getting to the scene room
is to use the controllers like binoculars -
hold one up to see the controller room (monocular) and both for a second
to magically transport there.)
