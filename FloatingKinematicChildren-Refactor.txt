Rework how children interact with the physics system.
Currently we just don't support child objects having physics bodies at all.
Better would be to just reuse the current transformation hierarchy
and have kinematic (aka Floating) objects be orchestrated after calculating the
final transformations of all child entities.

We'll have to do something about scale but it should be supportable - the issue here
is we currently recreate collisionobjects when setting scale and we don't want to
do that on every rigidbody on every frame unless needed, so need a way to see if scale has changed.
Can also see about getting rid of that workaround and trying to use Bullet's localscaling again.

We need to generally rethink our various systems for object composition with Bullet in mind anyway,
and add nicer support for bullet's constraints and compound objects.
