Get rid of withSystem in favor of viewSys â€” it's ok to crash on a missing system.
(think about this a bit more; I feel like I always regret introducing partial functions...)

- Syntax ideas:

dynamicsWorld <- viewSystem sysPhysics psDynamicsWorld
dynamicsWorld <- view psDynamicsWorld <$> viewSystem sysPhysics
dynamicsWorld <- sysPhysics >. psDynamicsWorld

audit for uses of withSystem to make sure modifySystem wasn't meant instead



Need to support:
- [ ] EntityLibrary with spawning by name, and optional persistence
      (An entity template is a Vault? A (Map String Value)? 
      Don't want to pay deserialization cost...)
- [ ] Saving entities and scenes (with references to entities)
- [ ] Associated components, e.g. mass with rigidbody, delete the rigidbody and lose mass too?


- Move Selection to its own system so CodeEditor and SceneEditor can use it

- Add FocusedCodeEditor to CodeEditor to use rather than selectedEntity

- PlayPause -> System?
